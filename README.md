# hello-world
First Github repository

Hello fellow people or intelligent vegetables(I know you're out there).

I'm Nick.  Just getting into coding for the first time... technically.  I could write basic in the 90's.  At least enough to make little programs and a few games.  But I did a bit of web design in the mid 2000's mostly using MX.  I have a pretty good understanding of the basics and the fundamental structure of things.  But I'm still trying to get a handle on the syntax and css.
